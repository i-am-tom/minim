I've been stuck in quarantine. I decided to try Elm.

This is the result of about 8 hours of work over 2 days.

## What is this?

When you're learning harmonic theory, there are a few things that are useful to
practise:

- Calculating intervals between notes
- Calculating voicings of particular chords
- ~Calculating diatonic intervals~ (coming soon/later/never)

This little tool is meant to help you practise these by setting up a
three-minute quiz. There's a high score and everything, so you _know_ it's
good.

## Controls

The **piano keys** all have labels. These are the keyboard keys you should
press. They're laid out like the piano, as best as I could.

Pressing a key will **toggle** it - pressing and holding confuses my bad code.
When you think you have the answer, press **enter** to get the next test.
